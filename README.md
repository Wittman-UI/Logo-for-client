Overview
This project documents the design process and thought behind creating a custom logo for my mother. The logo combines a hand-drawn camera icon with her name, "Abigél," written in a flowing script style.

Design Choices
1. Camera Icon
The camera represents my mother's passion for photography. I drew it with a simple outline and added a spiral swirl inside, symbolizing creativity and the dynamic nature of photography.
The swirl also adds a playful, personal touch, making the icon look unique and hand-crafted, like a signature.
2. Typography
I chose to write "Abigél" in a cursive style to give the logo a friendly, personal, and artistic feel. The flowing lines of the script are intended to convey warmth and approachability, reflecting her personality.
The tall, elegant letters add a sense of sophistication, while the large, looping letters in "Abigél" give the logo a lively, eye-catching look.
