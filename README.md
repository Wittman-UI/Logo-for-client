# Logo-for-"client"-
Overview
This project documents the design process and thought behind creating a custom logo for my mother. The logo combines a hand-drawn camera icon with her name, "Abigél," written in a flowing script style.

# Design Choices
1. Camera Icon
The camera represents my mother's passion for photography. I drew it with a simple outline and added a spiral swirl inside, symbolizing creativity and the dynamic nature of photography.
The swirl also adds a playful, personal touch, making the icon look unique and hand-crafted, like a signature.
2. Typography
I chose to write "Abigél" in a cursive style to give the logo a friendly, personal, and artistic feel. The flowing lines of the script are intended to convey warmth and approachability, reflecting her personality.
The tall, elegant letters add a sense of sophistication, while the large, looping letters in "Abigél" give the logo a lively, eye-catching look.
# Process
1. Concept Sketching: I started with sketches on paper, experimenting with different ideas for the camera icon and typography.
2. Refinement: Once I settled on a design, I refined the lines and worked on balancing the camera icon with the text.
3. Digitalization: Finally, I scanned the design and traced it digitally to create a cleaner version for uploading and sharing.
